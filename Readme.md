# NoSQL Database Fundamentals

This repository aims to provide an introduction to NoSQL databases with practical examples using the following technologies:

- **Redis**
- **MongoDB**
- **Neo4j**
- **Elasticsearch**

## Objective

NoSQL databases have become widely popular due to their ability to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. This repository allows you to explore different types of NoSQL databases, each with its own specific use cases and advantages.

### What you will learn:
- **Redis**: An in-memory key-value store, ideal for high-performance applications such as caching.
- **MongoDB**: A document-oriented database that stores and manages large amounts of JSON or BSON data. Perfect for web applications that require flexibility in the data model.
- **Neo4j**: A graph database that allows modeling complex relationships between data, useful in areas like social networks or entity relationship management.
- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search and analytics engine, primarily used to index and query large amounts of text or log data.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed or pull the respective docker images and run them :
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)

Each technology has its own set of tools and libraries that you can use to integrate them into your applications.

## Repository Content

This repository contains code examples for each of the NoSQL databases mentioned above. You will find:
- **Redis**: Example of using Redis as a cache and for session management.
- **MongoDB**: Example of managing JSON documents for web applications.
- **Neo4j**: Example of creating and managing graphs for relationship management.
- **Elasticsearch**: Example of indexing and searching text data.
